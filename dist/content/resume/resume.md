## Professional Summary

A dynamic exponent of Indian Classical Dance dedicated to the preservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage. With a deep respect for the *Guru-Shishya Parampara*, I bridge ancient artistry with contemporary global audiences. My work—spanning performance, choreography, and education—emphasizes the dual energies of *Tandava* (vigor) and *Lasya* (grace), using dance as a medium for storytelling and spiritual dialogue.
