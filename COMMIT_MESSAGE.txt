feat: Implement YAML-based resume system with classic design

Implemented a fully configurable resume/CV generator with YAML-based
configuration and elegant classic styling matching the sample HTML design.

## Major Features

### YAML Configuration System
- Created `resume-config.yaml` for layout, colors, fonts, and section control
- Created `resume-data.yaml` for all resume content (personal info, experience, education, awards)
- Implemented `yaml-parser.ts` utility with TypeScript types for type-safe parsing
- Updated `content.service.ts` to load and parse YAML files instead of markdown
- Added support for enabling/disabling sections dynamically

### Classic Design Implementation
- Matched exact color scheme from sample HTML:
  * Primary: #7a1f1f (Deep Classical Red)
  * Gold: #bfa668 (Muted Gold)
  * Background: #FAFAFA (Off-white)
  * Sidebar: #161616 (Dark)
- Two-column layout: 30% dark sidebar + 70% main content
- Implemented proper typography hierarchy:
  * Cinzel (serif headings)
  * Playfair Display (serif subheadings)
  * Lato (sans-serif body)
  * JetBrains Mono (monospace for technical content)

### Image Styling & Positioning
- Applied soft grayscale filter to all images (brightness 1.2, contrast 0.95)
- Implemented pencil sketch effect for footer gallery images
- Fine-tuned image positioning:
  * 068.jpg: Centered with 15% zoom, positioned at 50% 50%
  * 0085.jpg: Positioned at 35%, height increased to 240px
  * 308.jpg: Circular thumbnail with 5x zoom, positioned at -10%
  * 039.jpg & 211.jpg: Footer gallery with sketch effect
- All images converted to grayscale for elegant, professional appearance

### Content Formatting & Alignment
- Implemented markdown parser (`text-formatter.tsx`) for **bold** and *italic* formatting
- Fixed all text alignment issues - everything now properly left-aligned
- Removed numeric bullets from Guru Parampara section for cleaner look
- Made Repertoire section consistent with other sections (no extra padding)
- Sidebar content now flush left-aligned without decorative borders

### Layout Optimization
- Reduced padding throughout for more compact, professional appearance:
  * Sidebar: p-10 → p-6
  * Main content: p-10 → p-8
  * Section gaps: gap-8 → gap-6
  * Header spacing: pb-15px → pb-3
- Tightened spacing between sidebar items (space-y-4 → space-y-3)
- Reduced font sizes for more efficient space usage
- Fixed header alignment (removed extra padding from name/title)

### Print/PDF Optimization
- Reduced print margins from 0.25in/0.3in to 0.15in/0.2in for wider content
- Ensured all colors preserved in PDF with print-color-adjust
- Proper page break handling with page-break-inside-avoid
- Optimized font sizes for print (8pt body, 12pt headings)
- Fixed Download PDF button visibility (maroon background, white text)

### Component Architecture
- Created `ResumeSection.tsx` with dynamic rendering for all section types:
  * GuruParamparaItem (numbered list without bullets)
  * ExperienceItem (title/role layout)
  * PerformanceItem (repertoire as bullet list)
  * EducationItem, AwardItem, CertificationItem
- Updated TypeScript types with GuruParamparaItem and TeachingPhilosophy
- Implemented proper type checking and validation

### CSS Enhancements
- Added custom CSS classes for image effects:
  * .soft-grayscale (profile images)
  * .sketch-effect (black & white sketch)
  * .pencil-sketch-effect (pencil drawing with blur)
  * .oil-paint-effect (color oil painting)
- Imported JetBrains Mono font for technical content
- Updated Tailwind config with mono font family

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed Teaching Philosophy center alignment issue (added explicit text-left)
- Fixed Repertoire padding inconsistency (removed pl-5, added pl-0)
- Fixed header name/title alignment (removed default padding)
- Fixed sidebar content alignment (removed left borders and padding)
- Fixed circular thumbnail overflow (wrapped in container with overflow-hidden)
- Fixed Download PDF button visibility on light background

## Documentation
- Updated requirements.md with exact styling specifications
- Added 11 new requirements covering:
  * Font hierarchy including JetBrains Mono
  * Left-aligned content requirement
  * Sidebar styling specifications
  * Markdown parsing requirement
  * Image positioning and effects
- Created comprehensive README.md with:
  * Feature overview
  * Tech stack
  * Project structure
  * Installation instructions
  * Configuration guide
  * Customization options
  * Development guidelines
- Created .gitignore for Node.js/React project

## Technical Details
- Installed js-yaml and @types/js-yaml for YAML parsing
- Removed unused markdown parsing methods from content.service.ts
- Cleaned up unused resume.md file (now using YAML)
- All images positioned with precise objectPosition values
- Transform scale applied to images for zoom control
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
